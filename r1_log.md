### R1D1: January 1, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I started development on a Python application that takes the 100 most recent tweets on my timeline, and finds which memes are repeated the most (and thus, the most popular at the time).

**Thoughts** It feels great to start something new and interesting. We all love memes, and I'd love to get a script out of this that can be run periodically to find out which memes are most popular at different times. It also gets me started on more AI work, with OpenCV and feature matching.

**Key Topics:**
* Feature matching/AI with OpenCV
